# Firebase Token Generator - Java

[Firebase Custom Login](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/simple-login/custom.html)
gives you complete control over user authentication by allowing you to authenticate users
with secure JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). The auth payload stored in those tokens is available
for use in your Firebase [security rules](https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/api/rule/).
This is a token generator library for Java which allows you to easily create those JWTs.


## Installation

The easiest way to install the Firebase Java token generator is via Maven. Add this dependency
to your project:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.firebase</groupId>
  <artifactId>firebase-token-generator</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Otherwise, you can download the source and directly use it in your project. The token generator
has two run time dependencies:

1. `commons-codec-1.7.jar`
2. `json-20090211.jar`

Unit tests depend on jUnit 4.11.


## A Note About Security

**IMPORTANT:** Because token generation requires your Firebase Secret, you should only generate
tokens on *trusted servers*. Never embed your Firebase Secret directly into your application and
never share your Firebase Secret with a connected client.


## Generating Tokens

To generate tokens, you'll need your Firebase Secret which you can find by entering your Firebase
URL into a browser and clicking the "Secrets" tab on the left-hand navigation menu.

Once you've downloaded the library and grabbed your Firebase Secret, you can generate a token with
this snippet of Java code:

```java
Map<String, Object> authPayload = new HashMap<String, Object>();
authPayload.put("uid", "1");
authPayload.put("some", "arbitrary");
authPayload.put("data", "here");

TokenGenerator tokenGenerator = new TokenGenerator("<YOUR_FIREBASE_SECRET>");
String token = tokenGenerator.createToken(authPayload);
```

The payload object passed into `createToken()` is then available for use within your
security rules via the [`auth` variable](https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/api/rule/auth.html).
This is how you pass trusted authentication details (e.g. the client's user ID) to your
Firebase security rules. The payload can contain any data of your choosing, however it
must contain a "uid" key, which must be a string of less than 256 characters. The
generated token must be less than 1024 characters in total.


## Token Options

A second `options` argument can be passed to `createToken()` to modify how Firebase treats the
token. The `TokenOptions` object has the following methods:

* **setExpires(Date)** - A timestamp denoting the time after which this token should no longer
be valid.

* **setNotBefore(Date)** - A timestamp denoting the time before which this token should be
rejected by the server.

* **setAdmin(boolean)** - Set to `true` if you want to disable all security rules for this
client. This will provide the client with read and write access to your entire Firebase.

* **setDebug(boolean)** - Set to `true` to enable debug output from your security rules. You
should generally *not* leave this set to `True` in production (as it slows down the rules
implementation and gives your users visibility into your rules), but it can be helpful for
debugging.

Here is an example of how to use the second `options` argument:

```java
Map<String, Object> authPayload = new HashMap<String, Object>();
authPayload.put("uid", "1");
authPayload.put("some", "arbitrary");
authPayload.put("data", "here");

TokenOptions tokenOptions = new TokenOptions();
tokenOptions.setAdmin(true);

TokenGenerator tokenGenerator = new TokenGenerator("<YOUR_FIREBASE_SECRET>");
String token = tokenGenerator.createToken(authPayload, tokenOptions);
```
